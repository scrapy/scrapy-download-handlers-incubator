Overview
========

This is a collection of semi-official download handlers for Scrapy_. See the
`Scrapy download handler`_ documentation for more information.

They should work and some of them may be later promoted to the official status,
but here they are provided as-is and no support or stability promises are
given. The documentation, including limitations and unsupported features, is
also provided as-is and may be incomplete.

As this code may intentionally use private Scrapy APIs, it specifies a tight
dependency on Scrapy. Currently only the unreleased 2.15.0 version is
supported.

Features overview
=================

The baseline for these handlers is the default Scrapy handler,
``HTTP11DownloadHandler``, which uses Twisted and supports HTTP/1.1. Feature
parity with it is an explicit goal but it's not always possible and not all
possible features are implemented in all handlers (which may change in the
future). Certain popular features not supported by ``HTTP11DownloadHandler``,
like HTTP/2 support, and features unique to some handlers, may or may not be
implemented. Please see the sections for individual handlers for more details.

The following table summarizes the most important differences:

========================= ============ ================ ============ ============ ============= ==================

The following basic features are supported by all handlers unless mentioned in
their docs:

* Native asyncio integration without requiring a Twisted reactor
* HTTP/1.1 for ``http`` and ``https`` schemes
* Unified download handler exceptions
* Proxies, including HTTP and HTTPS proxies for HTTP and HTTPS destinations
* Proxy authentication via ``HttpProxyMiddleware``
* IPv6 destinations
* ``DOWNLOAD_MAXSIZE``, ``DOWNLOAD_WARNSIZE`` and the respective request meta
  keys
* ``DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT`` and the respective request meta key
* ``DOWNLOAD_FAIL_ON_DATALOSS`` and the ``"dataloss"`` flag
* Setting the ``download_latency`` request meta
* ``DOWNLOAD_BIND_ADDRESS``
* ``DOWNLOAD_VERIFY_CERTIFICATES``
* ``headers_received`` and ``bytes_received`` signals
* Not reading the proxy configuration from the environment variables
* Not handling cookies, redirects, compression and other things handled by
  Scrapy itself

Handlers
========

AiohttpDownloadHandler

    }

Features and limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

============================== =============================================================================

Notable features supported by the library but not implemented:

CurlCffiDownloadHandler
-----------------------

This handler supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 and uses the curl_cffi_ library.

Install it with:

.. code:: bash

    pip install scrapy-download-handlers-incubator[curl-cffi]

Enable it with:

.. code-block:: python

    DOWNLOAD_HANDLERS = {
        "http": "scrapy_download_handlers_incubator.CurlCffiDownloadHandler",
        "https": "scrapy_download_handlers_incubator.CurlCffiDownloadHandler",
    }

Features and limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

============================== ========================================
Proxies                        Yes
HTTP/2                         Yes
HTTP/3                         Yes (but not tested)
TLS verbose logging            No (not supported by the library)
``response.ip_address``        Yes
``response.certificate``       No (not supported by the library)
Per-request ``bindaddress``    No (not supported by the library)
Proxy certificate verification Follows ``DOWNLOAD_VERIFY_CERTIFICATES``
============================== ========================================

Notable features supported by the library but not implemented:

* Impersonation
* Advanced libcurl tunables

Settings
^^^^^^^^

* ``CURL_CFFI_HTTP_VERSION`` (``str``, default: ``"v1"``, corresponding to
  "Enforce HTTP/1.1"): The HTTP version to use. The value is passed directly to
  the library so the possible values are set by
  ``curl_cffi.requests.utils.normalize_http_version()`` and the meanings of the
  underlying constants can be seen in libcurl docs (CURLOPT_HTTP_VERSION_). Set
  this to ``"v2tls"`` or ``"v2"`` to enable HTTP/2 for HTTPS requests or for
  all requests respectively. Set this to ``"v3"`` to enable HTTP/3.
