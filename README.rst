Overview
========

This is a collection of semi-official download handlers for Scrapy_. See the
`Scrapy download handler`_ documentation for more information.

They should work and some of them may be later promoted to the official status,
but here they are provided as-is and no support or stability promises are
given. The documentation, including limitations and unsupported features, is
also provided as-is and may be incomplete.

As this code may intentionally use private Scrapy APIs, it specifies a tight
dependency on Scrapy. Currently only the unreleased 2.15.0 version is
supported.
